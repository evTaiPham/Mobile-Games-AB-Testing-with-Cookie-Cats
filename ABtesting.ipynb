Of cats and cookies\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame\">Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href=\"http://tactile.dk\">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic \"connect three\"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding! Check out this short demo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GaP5f0jVTWE\"><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_184/img/cookie_cats_video.jpeg\" style=\"width: 500px\"></a></p>\n<p>As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_184/img/cc_gates.png\" alt></p>\n<p>But where should the gates be placed? Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, but in this notebook we're going to analyze an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will look at the impact on player retention. But before we get to that, a key step before undertaking any analysis is understanding the data. So let's load it in and take a look!</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing pandas\n# ...

A common metric in the video gaming industry for how fun and engaging a game is <em>1-day retention</em>: The percentage of players that comes back and plays the game <em>one day</em> after they have installed it.  The higher 1-day retention is, the easier it is to retain players and build a large player base. </p>\n<p>As a first step, let's look at what 1-day retention is overall.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"24"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The % of users that came back the day after they installed\n# ...

The conclusion\n<p>The bootstrap result tells us that there is strong evidence that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The conclusion is: If we want to keep retention high — both 1-day and 7-day retention — we should <strong>not</strong> move the gate from level 30 to level 40. There are, of course, other metrics we could look at, like the number of game rounds played or how much in-game purchases are made by the two AB-groups. But retention <em>is</em> one of the most important metrics. If we don't retain our player base, it doesn't matter how much money they spend in-game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_184/img/cookie_yellow.png\" style=\"width:100px; float:center\"> </p>\n<p>So, why is retention higher when the gate is positioned earlier? One could expect the opposite: The later the obstacle, the longer people are going to engage with the game. But this is not what the data tells us. The theory of <em>hedonic adaptation</em> can give one explanation for this. In short, hedonic adaptation is the tendency for people to get less and less enjoyment out of a fun activity over time if that activity is undertaken continuously. By forcing players to take a break when they reach a gate, their enjoyment of the game is prolonged. But when the gate is moved to level 40, fewer players make it far enough, and they are more likely to quit the game because they simply got bored of it. </p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"74"},"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# So, given the data and the bootstrap analysis\n# Should we move the gate from level 30 to level 40 ?\nmove_to_level_40 = ... # True or False ?","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
